# Food Recipes

### *The main idea of this project is for users to be able to share their food recipe, to filter recipes, rate them, and use them as a lunch idea*

#### Additional functionalities:
- A user can post recipes for food, but first the admin must approve them.

- The user can filter the recipes by category *(healthy food, fast food, vegan food, vegetarian food*)

- If the user has no idea what to cook, then he can check the ingredients, and see which recipes he can make.
